# üìä How It Works

The **Email Spam Classifier** uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify emails as spam or not spam. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the workflow:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
To ensure accurate predictions, raw email data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### Steps:
- **Remove HTML Tags**: Emails often contain HTML tags, which are unnecessary for text analysis.
- **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase for consistency.
- **Remove Stop Words**: Common words (like *and*, *the*, *is*) are removed using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
- **Tokenization**: Break down the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root forms (e.g., *running* ‚Üí *run*).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction
Raw text is converted into numerical representations that the machine learning model can understand.

### Techniques:
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents the frequency of each word in the text.
- **TF-IDF**: Measures how important a word is to a document in relation to the entire dataset.
---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
After preprocessing and feature extraction, machine learning models are trained to classify emails.

### Models Used:
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**:
  - Well-suited for text classification.
  - Assumes independence between features (works well despite this assumption).
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - A probabilistic model ideal for binary classification.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
  - Maximizes the margin between spam and not-spam classifications.
- **Ensemble Methods (Optional)**:
  - Combine multiple models for improved accuracy (e.g., Random Forest).

**We used Naive Bayes Classifer in this Project**
---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
The trained model is tested against a validation set to measure performance.

### Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Ratio of true spam predictions to all spam predictions.
- **Recall**: Ratio of correctly identified spam to all actual spam emails.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall for a balanced evaluation.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Prediction
Once trained, the model is deployed for real-time email classification.

### Features:
- **Upload Functionality**: Users can upload email text files for classification.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Paste email content directly into the interface to get instant results.
---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment
The trained model and interface are packaged into a user-friendly application.

### Tools:
- **Streamlit**: Creates a web interface for predictions.
